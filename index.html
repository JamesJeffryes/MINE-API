<h2 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<p>The MINE database is fundamentally composed of two different types of documents, which are represented by the Compound and Reaction objects. Users can use text-matching queries to access these records directly or perform two types of more advanced queries: Mass Adduct queries and pathway queries. Mass Adduct queries return a list of compounds that might match the m/z of an unknown compound. Pathway queries return either the shortest path or all paths between two compounds in the database.</p>
